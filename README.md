# Batman Arkham knight Subtitle Tool
**by NoobInCoding**

This is a batman arkham knight subtitle localization tool that I made earlier for the Farsisaz.com team.

USAGE:
 - Export Folder : BatmanAK-SubtitleTool.exe -e <FolderName Or FileName> [Language]
 - Import Folder : BatmanAK-SubtitleTool.exe -i <FolderName Or FileName> [Language]
  
NOTES:
 - The tool ONLY works with uncompressed upk files. You can use the [decompress tool](https://www.gildor.org/down/47/umodel/decompress.zip) (by glidor) to decompress the files
 - For Import Folder/File , the exported text file must be inside/besides the selected folder/file
 - Language Is Default on English but if you want to change it you must enter a number between 0 to 11
